f1fsv6,Misinformation is spreading in Italy and it comes directly from official sources,"Our medias and our health officials are spreading false information, two examples:

1) In a press release on Jan 30th, the director of the National Institute for Infectious Diseases said that asymptomatic transmission is not a thing.  
Here is [the video of the press release](https://youtu.be/tKiwp1u780g), at around minute 9:00, he says: “as you know, normally, the infection is transmitted **after** the onset of the symptoms”.

2) [This spot from the Ministry of Health](https://youtu.be/0356dNANu6s) is being aired on TV and it says: “Yes, I know what you’re thinking about. Coronavius affects the respiratory tract, **but contagion is not easy**. Expecially if we follow prudent hygiene rules..”.

In Canada I would not be leaving the airport during the layover. In France and Italy I will be traveling by train and bus, going to many popular tourist spots, different hotels every night. 

This trip is hard to explain without too much detail,  it’s sort of through my school but not school based. I have a travel plan, but I don’t think I can get my money back if I don’t go unless I am already hospitalized/very sick. 

Assuming I do still go, what precautions should I take? I will be sharing a room with someone each night and generally be traveling with the same ~30 people the whole time.

The 4th case of coronavirus (first one in Lombardy region) was confirmed tonight 21st February at 1 AM by Lombardy's Health Assessor Gallera

The man is 38 years old, born in Castiglione d'Adda and residing in Codogno (near Lodi, a town near Milan). Other two cases have been confirmed: his pregnant wife and a friend.

Other two people of the same town (Codogno) have suspect symptoms so they are now being tested for COVID-19

What we know now:

\- The 38 years old man has NEVER been to China. He's not in ICU at Codogno hospital. His pregnant wife and their friend are at Sacco hospital in Milan (hospital for infectious diseases)

\- On Sunday 16th February the 38 years old man who works at Unilever in Casalpusterlengo town (he played a futsal match and a running event in the past 2 weeks), went to emergency room with flu-like symptoms but since he has never been to China he was not tested for COVID-19 and was given antibiotics. Now he's in critical conditions.

\- The man who passed COVID-19 to the 38 years old is currently under examination t Sacco Hospital in Milan (hospital for infectious diseases)  and he has no symptoms.  
The man is a manager who works in a multinational company in Fiorenzuola d'Arda and he came back from China between 20th and 21st January. This man and the 38 years old man had dinner back in the end of January. Health Assessor Gallera said ""between the dinner and the first symptoms, 16-18 days have passed""

Health Assessor Gallera asked people from Castiglione d'Adda (4600 citizens) and Codogno (16.000 citizens) to stay at home and not engace in social events and NOT TO GO TO EMERGENCY ROOM IF THEY SUSPECT COVID-19, but call a special emergency number",https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f79em6/more_details_about_the_last_3_cases_in_italy/,2020-02-21 05:46:42,Local Report,0.25

Without having any health issue he proceded to live his life as normal, meeting his family and some friends. Some of them caught the virus, proceding to spread it around Lodi, specially through medical staff that cured some of the people who had the symptoms. In the meantime we discovered that one patient in Codogno and another one in Veneto died due to coronavirus. At the moment the government is trying to contain the virus but it looks like the battle is already lost: just today the rough number of people that have the disease (tested) skyrocketed from 27 to 50-60 (number is ajourning every hour).  
The government is giving raccomendations for people to stay home if they are near Lodi and the whole zone is exempted from work, school etcetera. Some hospitals are in quarantene since a lot of doctors are confirmed to have coronavirus ([https://tg24.sky.it/milano/2020/02/22/coronavirus-quarantena-ospedale-baggio-milano.html](https://tg24.sky.it/milano/2020/02/22/coronavirus-quarantena-ospedale-baggio-milano.html) ) . Codogno and other 10 municipalites are ghost towns.   
It is now being proposed to move the 250 people who are waiting for the test results into military hospitals.

On the counters of pharmacies, on the shelves of supermarkets or in the tobacconists of the stations the price has been increased: two, three times more, while on Amazon, the largest e-commerce in the world, some private sellers have increased the price up to 700 %. A single 80 ml bottle is on sale for 22 euros and is currently out of stock on the online store. You can choose the convenience pack of 12 packs, each of 80ml, in order to ""save"" a good 6 euros per bottle for a total cost of 200 euros, that is 208 euros per liter. This salesman is not the worst because another advertiser offers 4 bottles of Amuchina X Germ from 80ml to 84.99 euros, that is, 21 euros each for 252 euros per liter.

By Jason Horowitz and Elisabetta Povoledo
Feb. 23, 2020
Updated 9:18 p.m. ET

CASALPUSTERLENGO, Italy — Europe confronted its first major outbreak of the coronavirus as an eruption of more than 150 cases in Italy prompted officials on Sunday to lock down at least 10 towns, close schools in major cities and cancel sporting events and cultural touchstones, including the end of the Venice carnival.

The worrisome spike — from fewer than five known cases in Italy before Thursday — shattered the sense of safety and distance that much of the continent had felt in recent months even as the virus has infected more than 78,000 worldwide and killed more than 2,400, nearly all in China.

The perception of a rising threat was amplified on television channels, newspaper headlines and social media feeds across Europe, where leaders could face their greatest challenge since the 2015 migration crisis.

That surge of people into Europe radically altered the politics of the European Union and exposed its institutional weaknesses. This time, it is an invisible virus from abroad that has slipped past Europe’s borders and presents its bickering coalitions with a new potential emergency.
If the virus spreads, the fundamental principle of open borders within much of Europe — so central to the identity of the bloc — will undergo a stress test, as will the vaunted but strained European public health systems, especially in countries that have undergone austerity measures.

Already, a new nervousness has pervaded Europe.

In Italy’s Lombardy region, 10 towns were locked down after a cluster of cases suddenly emerged in Codogno, southeast of Milan.

Residents were supposed to leave or enter the towns only with special permission, affecting at least 50,000 people and by Sunday night, police officers in surgical masks were waving down cars.  

Austrian officials stopped a train en route from Italy to Austria and Germany to test passengers for the virus.  The Austrian interior minister, Karl Nehammer, said the tests came back negative so the train got the “all clear.”

In France, the new health minister, Olivier Veran, stressed the country’s preparedness, saying it would significantly ramp up its testing.
“There is a problematic situation at the door, in Italy, that we are watching with great attention,” he said on Sunday, adding that a Europe-wide discussion between health ministers was in the works.

On Sunday night, an aid ship bringing hundreds of migrants, who had been rescued off the coast of Libya, to a Sicilian port received instructions from the Italian government to remain in quarantine for 14 days as a precaution, according to the ship’s Twitter account.

Fears of foreigners spreading the virus across oceans has already prompted some governments around the world to impose new border or travel controls.  


The Trump administration has barred entry to the United States by most foreign nationals who have recently visited China, where the virus first appeared and spread. Much of the world has adopted similar controls, but the virus has continued to spread, most notably to South Korea, where more cases have been recorded than anywhere else outside China, and this past week to Iran, where eight deaths have been reported.

Israel on Monday will block entry to all nonresidents who have visited Japan and South Korea in the 14 days before their arrival. On Sunday, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, which has 763 confirmed infections and six deaths, put the country on the highest possible alert, empowering the government to ban visitors from China and take other sweeping measures to contain the outbreak.
“The coming few days will be a critical time for us,” Mr. Moon said at an emergency meeting of government officials.

Even China — with an authoritarian government that has locked down areas with tens of millions of people in an attempt to stamp out the epidemic — has struggled to contain the virus, which has no known cure.

But the scores of new cases in Italy,  mostly in the Lombardy region that includes densely populated Milan, present a new challenge for a country with a wobbly government often paralyzed by infighting.

That government has now become the reluctant laboratory to test whether the virus can be successfully contained in an open European society with a liberal approach to restrictions.  

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy said on Italian television on Sunday that the country had taken precautions, including barring flights from China in January. These measures seemed to have paid off “even if now it looks like it didn’t,” he said.

He suggested that the surge of Italian cases only reflected Italy’s casting a wider net in terms of testing.  

“We cannot exclude that after tests that are equally rigorous, the numbers can go up in other countries,” Mr. Conte said.

Beatrice Lorenzin, a former Italian health minister, said the sharp rise in cases in Italy resulted from systematic checks that discovered a “second generation of contagion.”

She said this was probably caused by infected people who traveled to Italy from China using indirect flights without declaring their original departure point or putting themselves in voluntary quarantine during the virus’ incubation period.

“I hope similar things did not happen in other countries,” she said.

The outbreak in Codogno, in Lombardy, was detected after a 38-year-old man was admitted to the city’s hospital and diagnosed with the virus on Thursday. But the man had developed symptoms perhaps five days before that, potentially allowing the virus to spread.

Health officials are trying to figure out how he contracted the virus; he had not been to China. Many cases in Lombardy, officials say, may be traceable to that one case.

At least five members of the hospital medical staff and several patients have been infected. Other persons who tested positive include the man’s pregnant wife, some friends, and others who spent time with them. The towns surrounding the ones where the man works and lives have been included in the shutdown.

On Sunday night on a road outside Casalpusterlengo, one of the locked-down towns, police officers in surgical masks halted cars, asking what business they had in the town.  The officers suggested that motorists take an alternate route  and urged them against going any further.

Most of the drivers didn’t need much convincing.

Bahije Mounia, a 42-year-old caretaker from a nearby town who wore a surgical mask, turned right back around. She said the government should have let people in the area know how dangerous things were much earlier. With the spike of cases in the region, she said, “It’s almost like we’re in China.”

What had seemed like a contained few cases spread throughout the country’s wealthy north. So did the precautions.

People wore surgical masks in Aosta, which is on the Swiss border.  Officials in the Piedmont region closed schools in Turin, and Venice cut its Carnival short. The patriarch of Venice, the Reverend Francesco Moraglia, suspended all religious ceremonies, including Ash Wednesday celebrations that mark the beginning of Lent.

At least two trade fairs in Milan, cornerstones of the city’s economy, were postponed.  But the women’s fashion shows, except for those by Armani, continued  on schedule on Sunday to large crowds, with few wearing masks, The Associated Press reported.   The Giorgio Armani fashion house made a last-minute decision to stream its shows from empty theaters.

Two elderly people who tested positive for the coronavirus were in intensive care at Venice’s municipal hospital.

In the regional capital of Milan, officials closed museums, schools, its cathedral, and halted religious and cultural events. Many other venues, aside from those providing essential services, have been closed, including most bars and nightclubs.

Fears that the city could be quarantined triggered a run on supermarkets. By 5 p.m. on Sunday, at least one supermarket had run out of fruit, vegetables, meat and nearly all canned food.

Some of the customers wore masks, and they all seemed in a hurry to fill up their carts with whatever was left on the shelves.

Vanessa Maiocchi, 45, said she worried about getting her children enough food. She was also concerned that her brother, who has a weak immune system, might be more vulnerable, especially if his company kept making him go to work.

“At least in these cases,” she said, “the state should intervene.”

So far, the virus has killed three people in Italy, including a 78-year-old man from Veneto who died Friday; an elderly woman who died in Crema on Sunday; and a 77-year-old woman who died in her home in Casalpusterlengo and posthumously tested positive for the virus.

The Italian state, which leads the third largest economy in the eurozone, has not inspired much confidence of late, as it has been consumed by internal machinations. But health experts said they were more worried because the Italian health ministry appeared to have moved aggressively to prevent an outbreak, to no avail.  

Francesco Passerini, the mayor of Codogno, said in an interview on Sunday evening that he still had not received concrete logistical instructions from Rome.
“Who is going to bring essential goods here?” he said. “Who is going to take care of provisions and medical transportation?”

Two military structures in Lombardy are being prepared to become isolation camps. A military base in Rome has been housing evacuees from Wuhan, China, where the virus began, and the Italian passengers of the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship that has been under quarantine in Yokohama, Japan.

Lockdown procedures like the ones in Lombardy will be applied to other towns if new clusters emerge, officials said. Quarantine measures will also be applied to anyone who has close contact with someone who has the virus.

Elia Delmiglio, the mayor of Casalpusterlengo, said people continued going in and out of his town for most of the day on Sunday.

“We got the decree, but not a precise schedule for when it will be implemented,” he said.

But by late Sunday night, police began arriving to seal the town off.

“People are worried,” said Paolo Camia, a 55-year-old manager of a software company from Casalpusterlengo, who drove out of town in his blue surgical mask to take some pictures of the police checkpoints. “Basically, we can’t leave.”

Jason Horowitz reported from Casalpusterlengo, Italy, and Milan, and Elisabetta Povoledo reported from Rome. Katrin Bennhold contributed reporting from Berlin, Constant Meheut from Paris, and Emma Bubola from Milan.

 Activate protocol in Valdivia in case of a possible case of coronavirus in Chilean woman who was in Italy

In the afternoon of this Monday, the coronavirus confirmation protocol was activated at the Valdivia Base Hospital in the Los Ríos Region.

 The specialist medical team is evaluating the health status of a 45-year-old woman who arrived at the hospital site presenting symptoms similar to those of influenza.

As confirmed by the Health Seremi of the Los Ríos Region, the patient ""entered the country last February 21 from Italy, a country that has an outbreak for COVID-19, so the protocol to rule out coronavirus has been applied"" .

After this, from the entity they assured that the results of the applied test will be announced during the next hours.

 The director of the World Health Organization (WHO) called on the world on Monday to prepare for an ""eventual pandemic"" of the new coronavirus and described the sudden increase in new cases in Italy, South Korea and Iran as ""very worrying.""

In contrast, the rate of expansion of the COVID-19 epidemic declined in China, where new cases have fallen since early February, WHO said.

Experts from the WHO joint mission determined that in China ""the epidemic peaked, stabilized between January 23 and February 2 and has continuously declined since then,"" said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

""This should give countries the hope that this virus can be contained,"" he added and greeted again the drastic measures taken by China, where tens of millions of people have been confined for weeks.

In other parts of the world, the epidemic of viral pneumonia accelerated on Monday, with balances rising sharply from South Korea to Iran, which now record the highest number of cases of contamination and deaths outside of China.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f8yie9/possible_case_in_chile_is_a_woman_with_45_years/,2020-02-24 16:27:10,Local Report,0.0
f8ypgs,"""The coronavirus epidemic in Italy began in a hospital. That is why there are so many cases"" - Milan's Sacco Hospital's Infectious Diseases Department Chief - Corriere de la Sera/El Mundo - 2/24/20","https://www.elmundo.es/internacional/2020/02/24/5e537cb621efa0a75d8b45f5.html

&gt;The head of the department of infectious diseases of the Sacco Hospital in Milan believes that the first patient was not well diagnosed in the hospital of Codogno and the epidemic in Italy spread so quickly because of it.

&gt;Italy has still not solved the mystery of how the coronavirus arrived in the country. After the man who was found to be 'patient 0' was found to be not, Italian authorities try to discover the origin of the outbreak, since none of the infected had recently traveled to China. As reported to Corriere della Sera by Massimo Galli, professor of infectious diseases at the University of Milan and head of the department of infectious diseases at Sacco Hospital in Milan, the outbreak of coronavirus in Italy began in a hospital.

&gt;""We have had the most unfortunate situation possible, that is, the beginning of an epidemic in the context of a hospital, same as happened with the MERS in Seoul in 2015. Unfortunately, in these cases, a hospital can become a terrifying place,"" affirms in an interview with the Italian newspaper.

&gt;Not knowing who is the 'patient zero' complicates everything from the point of view of the spread of the infection. It is now one of the main concerns of the Italian Government to learn the origin of this outbreak, since it would be strange that all initial infections were caused by a 38-year-old Italian who was first believed to have been infected when he had dinner with a friend who had been in China and had returned from this country on January 21. ""He is not the starting point of the coronavirus. That hypothesis was a mistake,"" said the Higher Institute of Health.

&gt;However, Sileri confirmed that the alleged ""patient zero"" who would have infected his friend after returning from China never had the virus. How did the coronavirus arrive in Italy, then? It is known how it spread, but the origin is unknown. According to Galli, everything indicates that the origin of the epidemic was in a hospital.

&gt;Galli's explanation is very simple: a patient goes to the hospital with symptoms that can be confused in the beginning with a simple flu, contact other patients who have the same disease or who come from a country affected by the infection. Those who went to Codogno hospital had not been to China and, among other things, it was later discovered that the person from Shanghai who had supposedly infected him had not contracted the infection. ""We still don't know who brought the coronavirus to the Codogno area, however, the first clinically demanding case of Covid-19 was treated without the necessary precautions because it was interpreted as another pathology,"" he says.

&gt;For this infectious disease specialist, what happened at the Codogno hospital was that the ""transmission actually started probably in a bar or another place that has yet to be verified"", but what Galli is sure is that ""the infections they are transmitted more easily in enclosed spaces and by relatively close contacts, less than two meters away."" In other words, ""the first patient's disease was not diagnosed correctly."" It should be remembered that 'patient 1' went to the hospital on February 18 with the first symptoms, but is not hospitalized. However, he is in the waiting room with other patients, with medical staff, etc. In fact, the second victim of the coronavirus outbreak in Italy is believed to have been infected in the waiting room of the Codogno hospital.

&gt;Galli points out that ""it is likely that someone, who arrived in an incubation phase, developed the infection when he was already in our country with a clinical picture without symptoms or with very mild symptoms, which allowed him to lead his life more or less in a way normal and so he could infect several people without knowing it. If we had stopped him at the border, we would also have ignored his situation. ""

&gt;The infectious disease expert also believes that most cases have occurred in the regions of Lombardy and Veneto because ""they are the regions where exchanges with China are most intense for economic and commercial reasons, and where there is also an important presence of Chinese citizens. And I don't want to say that the first to bring the coronavirus to Italy was a Chinese, he could also be an Italian businessman who recently traveled to the Asian country.""

&gt;In fact, the first victim of the Italian outbreak was a man who had not had any contact with the so-called 'patient 1' nor had he traveled to the Lombardy region. The authorities believe that he was infected in one of the bars he frequented, since another client has also tested positive. On February 9, the first victim, 78, goes to one of these bars to watch the Inter-Milan match along with eight Chinese, of which two of them had just returned from China.

&gt;Faced with this picture, the WHO expressed this weekend its concern about the rate of expansion of the epidemic. ""We have seen a very rapid increase (in cases) in a few days,"" said Sylvie Briand, director of the WHO Global Preparedness for Infectious Risks department. Obviously, without the origin of infections, it is even harder to decide what to do to contain the virus. An opinion also shared by Galli, who believes that it is necessary to ""understand now how the infection has spread and how it will spread"" and for this you need to know its origin.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f8ypgs/the_coronavirus_epidemic_in_italy_began_in_a/,2020-02-24 16:39:19,Local Report,0.5

I'm flying to Bergamo (close to isolated Italian towns) on Wednsday to help my parents, who are already there and moving in to their new flat at Lake Garda.

I'm asking myself if my wife and I should make any travelling preparation considering the Corona situation there? 

I read on this sub that hand desinfectant + FFP3 mask prices are exploding, so I'll definatly be taking some of that with me... We dont have any checked in luggage (yet), so I could only take small bottles...

By what I've read so far, I don't think the situation is so bad that we should cancel our flights and tell our parents to get the f+ck out of there?  
But maybe it's smart prepping anyway?

Also: I work as a paramedic and I don't know how easy it is to get tested for the virus if you dont have any symptoms? Maybe it would be wise to do so before flying back to Germany before being in contact with patients? 
In my city (Cologne), a tourist with fever that came back from Italy was attended by fellow paramedics and at that time the Health Institute Robert Koch still had not classified Lombardei as a ""High Risk Zone"", which is why they told him to go to his normal doctors office and left. Two hours later the leading highest rank emergency doctor went to the patients home and took him to Quarantine at the next Hospital where they are waiting for results now.   Also , it was Carneval in Cologne today with over 1 Million visitors.. Venice carneval was cancelled, Cologne wasn't. I wouldn't be surprised if we hear of an outbreak in Cologne in the next days...

I live and work in the very center of Rome.
As someone else pointed out ppl are going crazy here: no masks on local community’s faces, not even tourists seem worried, but a lot of big stores stormed and now... those big trucks today.
I’ve already made stocks, I’m not worried about the situation (food and stuff). I just can’t understand how can nobody talk about what’s really happening.
A friend of mine works in a big hospital outside Rome, they were quarantined for a suspected case (last Friday, Sant’Andrea hospital), they toke the patient to Spallanzani(H) and then it was just said the situation became normal because suspected case was tested negative. Fact is they are all still under observation, other patients, doctors, nurses.. wasn’t negative the test?
Alcoholic products for disinfection are no longer available in a lot of pharmacies, no masks, gloves are finishing.

My friend's parents live in Lombardy and he left a day before the quarantine back to Bologna to work, then when the quarantine was put in place his parents paid for him to go to his sister's place in my town two days later and stay there until it all cools of. At the Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam he just told me an hour ago that there were no checks on Italian people who have relatives or contact, no thermal imaging, no nothing. He simply walked through, got on the train and is on his way to stay with us. Now, he rarely went outside, but I am still a bit concerned, especially since he thought in Lombardy there is one case when in fact it's 16 confirmed cases just there. I will advise him more about the Covid-19 when he gets here. I thought that people should know that this virus is really easy to spread in other countries, especially here in the West of Europe.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f99gwj/my_friend_from_lombardy_italyand_the_airport/,2020-02-25 07:22:52,Local Report,0.0

A group of students from Lindenhurst High School are sick after they traveled to Italy during the winter break.

School district officials say the students are showing symptoms that indicate the flu, norovirus or possibly salmonella.

The illnesses come amid a coronavirus outbreak in Italy.

In a letter to parents, the Lindenhurst school superintendent says the symptoms the students are showing are not the same symptoms of the coronavirus.

Parents in the community say they are still concerned.

The Suffolk Health Department says no one in the county is currently under investigation for the coronavirus.

More than 200 people have tested positive for the coronavirus in Italy and at least six have died.

f9cx25,Just got done talking with my aunt in Italy,"My aunt is currently in Salerno, IT where she has currently been residing with relatives while they wait this through.  I wasn’t able to talk for long as she had things to do and others contacting her but I thought I should at least share with everyone.  Southern Italy just reported their first cases as well as many other places around the world, which obviously has everyone there concerned.  Face masks and hand sanitizers are in limited supplies, including online. Fortunately, I stocked up on 2 cases of face masks a couple weeks ago as I had been paying attention.  I made sure to wear mask while talking to her from a room that is now the cell phone room, and took a shower and immediately washed all my clothes after speaking with her.  I know the odds are slim but a potential analog &gt; digital &gt; analog transmission mutation of this disease has me taking extra precautions including even wearing gloves and covering up the mic and cam on my laptops and tablets.  I was even thinking about pulling out an of CRT TV I have up in the attic saved just for this purpose but I am not sure if I am panicking and following general hysteria.  Better safe than sorry.

Bari, Taranto, and Foggia are all cities in Southern Italy.  In 2013 I was not anywhere near those areas but on a vacation in the Bahamas while my aunt was still in Italy, going through veterinarian school.  This is the time I first spoke to her about global matters, although at the time we did not discuss epidemics or pandemics but I know people were thinking about them in Geneva during then as the WHO is located there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f9cx25/just_got_done_talking_with_my_aunt_in_italy/,2020-02-25 11:36:00,General,0.0

Not much flour, sugar, toilet paper left in Genoa supermarkets. Pasta and tomato sauce still available. Many supermarkets made an extra order to refill their daily inventory tomorrow. No panic at all, just people prepping, huge sales today.

Yesterday PM argued with regional governors, saying he is ready to revoke them powers about healtchare if they don't follow a common response protocol. He was expecially pissed with Liguria governor for closing the schools with no infects in the region, and with Marche one for proposing the same solution. 

He also complained with Codogno hospital staff for ""using too many swabs to test too many asymptomatics in the town"" (core of Lombardia cluster, where they ran out of swabs). More swabs ordered, we hope they will be shipped soon.

Today afternoon PM had a meeting with governors, and we've been told they decided to follow a common protocol: no schools closed in ""untouched"" regions. Meanwhile 2 cases were found in Liguria, where schools are already closed, so problem solved with Liguria and PM.

**22.00 Update:** Marche governor changed his mind right now, he is closing the schools.

PM and government are upset with Marche governor. ""he promised not to close schools in regions without infected patients, government is going to officially challenge the decision."" Ministers of regional affairs and istruction said. 

**00.00 Update:** 324th italian case found in Pesaro, Marche region.

f9qc3k,"Cancel our upcoming Europe Trip? Includes Italy (Naples &amp; Rome), GF is worried.","My girlfriend &amp; I (both in our late 20s) have had a three week Europe trip planned since late October, however it seems the spread of Coronavirus (CoVID-19) is growing throughout Europe. I've read this might be in light of an increased focus on detection (which is good), but I've also read that numbers could also be suppressed/inaccurate. 

We are set to leave early next month (March) and will visit the following cities: Barcelona &gt; Naples &gt; Rome &gt; Berlin &gt; Prague &gt; Amsterdam &gt; Paris

Personally, I feel we will be fine, but my girlfriend is starting to get quite worried. She's saying things like she thinks her immune system might not be strong enough, we might get stuck somewhere (quarantined or stuck on a train), or how we might bring it home to family (getting our parents sick).... I really don't want her to have these awful thoughts as we embark on what's meant to be a fun trip or feel uncomfortable on the planes/trains...that's not exactly the vision we had when we planned this trip initially.

I also have friends &amp; family giving me similar perspectives based on their mainstream media understandings. All of this noise has me feeling quite confused on whether or not I should cancel/postpone the trip. 

Hoping to get some level headed advice here because I feel I'm just not thinking clearly on this one. I currently see my options as the following:

1. Cancel the entire trip. This will likely cost me somewhere around $1000-$1200 between non-refundable flights/accommodations. Luckily I've been busy with a project at work and didn't finalize the remaining hotels for some of the trip. I'm flying with American Airlines, so I think I might be able to get a credit and significantly reduce the loss here or leverage my Chase Ink card benefits.
2. Cancel the Italy portion only and maybe go to a different country (maybe Switzerland or Greece?). This will cost me around $100 in non-refundable flights/trains (RyanAir &amp; Italo). I feel like this is the option we will end up going with, but I'm really surprised how quickly the numbers jumped in Italy for confirmed cases. I am concerned this may happen in another area we are traveling to since we will be in Europe for 3 weeks.
3. Keep the trip, ""as-is"" and whatever happens, happens. This would require me to commit and finalize the remaining bookings. This would also be done knowing my girlfriend isn't entirely comfortable. I think her main concern right now is that she knows I put time &amp; money into the trip and doesn't want to have me feel the entire thing was a waste. She also doesn't have much money (teacher salary in South America) for doctor bills-medicine if she were to get sick. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Friends, family (mainly parents), &amp; girlfriend seem quite worried about Coronavirus spreading during an upcoming (early March) Europe trip. Between all the noise, hoping to get some level headed advice on the matter whether I should stay (in the US) or go (for the three week Euro trip).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f9qc3k/cancel_our_upcoming_europe_trip_includes_italy/,2020-02-26 03:43:05,Question,0.0

From today, the swabs for coronavirus will be performed ""only on symptomatic subjects"". This was stated by the director of the Superior Council of Health Franco Locatelli for civil protection. The swabs carried out so far have given a negative result in 95% of cases, he explained, confirming that the
risk of infection ""is high in symptomatic subjects while it is
markedly lower in asymptomatic subjects"". Hence the

Before northern Italy outbreak Spallanzani tested 68 suspects from Lazio, 3 of them were positive, in the last 4 days they tested 72 more suspects, all of them were negative, so 140 tests done by them alone, not considering all the swabs sent by northern Italy. 
In Spallanzani all the 3 positive cases results  recovered after a few weeks, they sent home just one of them after 7 days of negative tests, 2 more patients are currently in the hospital and negative, one of them was negative for 4 consecutive days and the other one was found negative today for the first time. 
Veneto found 2 “recovered” as well, meanwhile they just sent home both of them immediately after the test was negative, not waiting one week like Spallanzani hospital.
Plus, Rome is preparing for a possible outbreak (even though no more cases in Rome were found for more than 3 weeks), there are a lot of tents in front of Spallanzani hospital for future tests, they will also add more tents in front of every hospital in Rome soon.

f9yg77,"Coronavirus Live Updates: Cases Rise in Italy and Iran, and Spread to Other Countries","The number of new infections outside China has outpaced those inside the country for the first time, according to the World Health Organization.

RIGHT NOWThe epidemic has begun in Germany, the health minister said, after new infections apparently were contracted there.

—-

Coronavirus pushes across Europe and Middle East, while U.S. prepares for outbreak.

New cases of the coronavirus popping up across Europe. Dozens of infections in Iran stoking fears about an uncontrolled spread in the Middle East. Global market jitters continuing after a steep slide. American health authorities warning that it was a matter of when, not if, the epidemic would reach the United States. A toxic political climate in Washington complicating the public health challenge.

That worrying drumbeat frayed nerves across the world on Wednesday even as the pace of the outbreak seemed to be slowing in China.

For the first time, more new cases were reported outside China than inside, according to the World Health Organization. Chinese officials on Tuesday reported 411 new infections; in the rest of the world, the number was 427. The total number of cases globally has now reached 80,980 and nearly 3,000 have died.

In the European Union, which prides itself on open borders, new cases were recorded in Austria, Croatia, France, Germany, Greece and Spain. Most were tied to Italy, where the authorities have been struggling to contain an outbreak that has infected at least 325 people, most of them in the north near Milan.
Hotels in Austria, France and the Canary Islands of Spain were locked down this week after guests tested positive for the virus or were suspected of having it. The steps to limit contagion differed from place to place, but large group gatherings were often the first things to be canceled where the virus had been detected.

In China, the authorities cautioned that the falling infection rate might be only a temporary reprieve, while South Korean officials scrambled to contain the largest outbreak outside China. The U.S. military confirmed that one soldier stationed in South Korea had tested positive.

As the American health authorities braced for an outbreak in the United States, the Trump administration came under criticism from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers for contradictory statements on the severity of the crisis, a lack of transparency and seemingly lax preparations.

Brazil confirms coronavirus infection, the first in Latin America.

Brazil’s health ministry said on Wednesday that a 61-year-old man who recently traveled to São Paulo from Italy had contracted the coronavirus.

The first known case in Latin America, it comes as Brazil is in the midst of Carnival, a hugely popular festival that draws large crowds into close quarters for raucous street celebrations.

Officials were scrambling to track down other passengers on the flight the man took to Brazil and to find others who had come into contact with him in recent days.

The patient, who lives in São Paulo, had recently traveled for work to northern Italy, where an outbreak has infected at least 325 people. He sought medical help after experiencing a fever, cough and sore throat, according to health officials.

Brazil’s health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, told the G1 news site that officials were hopeful that the virus would not spread briskly in Brazil, given the warmer time of year.

“The virus behaves differently in the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere,” he said. “Brazil is a country of younger people, and we’re in summertime. This is a period that is not conducive for a respiratory virus.”

Iran’s leaders continued to downplay the seriousness of the outbreak there on Wednesday, even as the number of cases in Iran or linked to it kept climbing quickly.

The health ministry reported 139 cases and 19 deaths, up from 95 and 15 on Tuesday, and the government ordered a weeklong closure of schools and cultural sites in 10 provinces. Experts say Iran’s high apparent death rate suggests that it has far more infections than it has discovered or acknowledged.

But President Hassan Rouhani said that the virus was coming under control, and he predicted that things would return to normal by Saturday, Iranian state media reported. He added that Iran’s enemies were using the epidemic to further isolate the country.

The Coronavirus Outbreak
Answers to your most common questions:
Updated Feb. 26, 2020

How worried should I be?
New outbreaks in Asia, Europe and the Middle East are renewing fears of a global pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned this week that Americans should brace for the likelihood that the virus will spread to the United States.
How do I keep myself and others safe?
Washing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you’re sick.
What if I’m traveling?
The C.D.C. has warned older and at-risk travelers to avoid Japan, Italy and Iran. The agency also has advised against all non-essential travel to South Korea and China.
How can I prepare for a possible outbreak?
Keep a 30-day supply of essential medicines. Get a flu shot. Have essential household items on hand. Have a support system in place for eldery family members.
What is a Coronavirus?
It is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS.
Where has the virus spread?
The virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has sickened more than 80,000 people in at least 33 countries, including Italy, Iran and South Korea.
How contagious is the virus?
According to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is probably transmitted through sneezes, coughs and contaminated surfaces. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures.
Who is working to contain the virus?
The World Health Organization officials have been working with officials in China, where growth has slowed. But this week, as confirmed cases spiked on two continents, experts warned that the world is not ready for a major outbreak.

Iran has not closed pilgrimage sites that draw millions of Shiite Mulsims to the city of Qom, the center of the country’s outbreak. On Wednesday, the cleric in charge of one of the most important sites there, the Fatima Masumeh shrine, said people should keep visiting.

Bahrain on Wednesday raised its case total to 26, and said all three new patients had just arrived from Iran — as had some of the previous ones. Bahrain is one of several countries reporting infections in people who had recently traveled to Iran.
Pakistan’s health minister, Dr. Zafar Mirza, on Wednesday confirmed the first two cases of the coronavirus in that country, and said that one of them was a 22-year-old student who had recently returned from Iran. Pakistan closed its border with Iran on Sunday.

As new cases soar in South Korea, a U.S. soldier there tests positive.

As the number of new coronavirus infections in South Korea soared on Wednesday, the U.S. military ordered all people who had come into contact with an American soldier who tested positive for the virus to isolate themselves in their homes.

The 23-year-old soldier, one of n

nearly 30,000 U.S. troops based in the country and the first of them to be infected, is stationed at Camp Carrol in Waegwan, 12 miles from Daegu, the city at the center of South Korea’s outbreak.

South Korea reported 284 new cases on Wednesday, the largest single-day jump so far, as the authorities complete the testing hundreds of members of a secretive church in Daegu that has been hit hard by the virus.

South Korea now has 1,261 cases, the largest outbreak outside China.

The government says it is still unsure how the virus got to South Korea, but suspicions have been raised about the Shincheonji church, which has members in Wuhan, China, which has the world’s largest concentration of infections.

In response to the growing crisis, the U.S. military in South Korea elevated its risk level to “high” on Monday, advising all troops to “limit non-mission-essential” meetings and “off-installation travel.” At gates of American bases, assessment stations have been set up, with soldiers lining up for temperature checks and screening questionnaires.
Col. Edward Ballanco, the Army garrison commander for the affected area, said the military was arranging grocery deliveries to those quarantined.

On Tuesday, the United States and South Korea said they would consider scaling back joint military exercises after at least 13 South Korean soldiers were infected.

The U.S. military in Japan sent out a notice on Wednesday telling all personnel there to avoid nonessential travel to South Korea.

To Fight Stigma, Ukraine’s Health Minister Puts Herself in Quarantine

Ukraine’s minister of health has sequestered herself with a group of evacuees from China, trying to counteract exaggerated fears of people under coronavirus quarantines.

She missed her daughter’s birthday party, and she is not working at Ukraine’s Health Ministry at a busy time, as colleagues brace for the possibility of a coronavirus outbreak.

The health minister, Zoryana Skaletska, had pledged to join the group that had been in China during their two-week quarantine at a clinic in the countryside. The purpose, she said, is to puncture the stigma and fear of the virus.
“If it is safe here, in the same building, it is really safe for the whole population in the nearby cities,” Ms. Skaletska said in a telephone interview. “I hope people will become calm.”

Ms. Skaletska has been praised by some for her courageous leadership, but derided by others for what they are calling a reckless publicity stunt.

Ukraine, which has not reported a coronavirus case, evacuated 45 Ukrainians and 27 other nationals last week from China to the Poltava region. None has shown signs of illness, but they are in isolation for 14 days as a precaution.

On the day of their arrival, a protest broke out in the nearest village, Novi Saranzhy. Demonstrators blocked a road, burned tires and hurled stones at buses carrying the evacuees, breaking windows.

Should Ms. Skaletska contract the virus, which she said was unlikely, she said she would trust Ukraine’s doctors to see her through it.

“Even if I have a case of coronavirus, I am sure everything will be all right,” she said.

President Trump plans to hold a news conference with health officials.

President Trump said he would hold a news conference with officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at the White House on Wednesday, a day after conflicting assessments of the epidemic from him and his administration.

The news conference, to be held at 6 p.m. Eastern, will also include other officials, he wrote in a Twitter post. The president also attacked the news media for “doing everything possible” to make the situation look dire, “including 
panicking Mr. Trump has repeatedly tried to minimize fears about the coronavirus, saying on Tuesday that it was “very much under control” in the United States, and his top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said, “we have contained this.”

But on the same day, C.D.C. officials said U.S. institutions needed to prepare for an outbreak, which they described as inevitable. Alex M. Azar III, the secretary of health and human services, said, “we cannot hermetically seal off the United States to a virus.”

Mr. Trump lashed out on Wednesday at what he called “Do Nothing Democrat comrades,” even as his administration has come under fire from both Republicans and Democrats for not doing enough to prepare for the coronavirus in the United States.

His administration has asked Congress to allocate $1.25 billion in new emergency funds to bolster its coronavirus response.
TRUMP ON THE VIRUSPresident Trump had harsh works for the news media.
Germany’s health minister says source of some new infections cannot be traced.

A coronavirus epidemic has broken out in Germany, Health Minister Jens Spahn said Wednesday, after new cases were confirmed that cannot be traced to the virus’s original source in China.

The disease is moving to a new phase in Germany, Mr. Spahn said at a news conference.

“The infection chains are partially no longer trackable,” he said.

About 20 cases of the coronavirus have been identified in the country, he said, but until now health officials had been able to trace those who became infected back to the virus’s origins in central China or to hot spots in Italy.

Mr. Spahn said people should not panic, because “not every cough is a case of coronavirus.”

The authorities in Germany’s most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, were trying on Wednesday to retrace the steps of a couple who contracted the coronavirus from a source they could not immediately identify. This raised the troubling prospect that it might have been transmitted within the country itself.

The couple had spent the previous two weeks — the estimated incubation period for the virus — “taking part in normal, public life,” said Karl-Josef Laumann, the state health minister.

That included attending a large carnival party and taking a brief trip to the Netherlands, he said. Dutch authorities and the hotel where the couple stayed have been informed.

The authorities in the southwestern German state of Baden-Württemberg confirmed another new case, a 25-year-old man thought to have contracted the virus during a trip to Milan. On his return, he contacted local health officials and was placed in isolation.
As global markets continue to slide, Wall Street shows some signs of recovery.

Stocks on Wall Street appeared to be rebounding on Wednesday, recovering somewhat from back-to-back losses this week that had wiped more than 6 percent off the S&amp;P 500.

The recovery came as major markets in Europe and Asia continued to drift lower, with investors reacting to reports of the coronavirus spreading across the globe.

The S&amp;P 500 was up by about 0.5 percent in trading at midday on Wednesday. The benchmark had fallen by 3 percent on Tuesday and experienced its worst one-day slide in two years on Monday.


However, European markets fell more than 1 percent on Wednesday as investors weighed the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. Asian markets ended the trading day lower.

Investors have been dumping stocks all week, seeking safer investments like government bonds, as the outbreak spreads beyond Asia.

In trading on Wednesday, the DAX in Germany fell 2.1 percent, and the FTSE 100 in Britain was 1.1 percent lower. In Asia, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 0.7 percent and the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 0.8 percent.
Two European hotels remain locked down as new cases spread across the Continent.

Two European hotels were on lockdown on Wednesday as coronavirus infections spread on the Continent, and a third was quarantined for several hours.

The authorities in Innsbruck, an Austrian ski town in the Alps, sealed off the 108-room Grand Hotel after an Italian employee there tested positive for the virus. The cordon was the second at a European hotel in two days, after Spain on Tuesday cordoned off the H10 Costa Adeje Palace on the resort island of Tenerife after a guest, also from Italy, tested positive.

Each of the infected Italians had recently visited the Lombardy region of the country.

Though the virus originated in China, an outbreak in Italy has given it a foothold in Europe from which it has spread to at least five countries.

Spain, Austria, Croatia, Switzerland and France all reported cases linked to Lombardy on Tuesday.

In central France, the Ibis Center hotel in Beaune was closed after a client from Hong Kong died during the night. The health authorities ordered that all 30 members of the guest’s group remain in isolation while tests were conducted.

But the tests results on Wednesday afternoon did not show coronavirus, and the lockdown was lifted.
THE VIRUS IN TENERIFEWhat happens when a vacation turns into a lockdown?
Nurses in Wuhan make a bold appeal for international help.

Nurses in Wuhan, China, psychologically stressed and physically exhausted, appealed to medical workers around the world to come to the heart of the outbreak and help them treat the thousands of infected people there.

The unusually public appeal for help, made in an open letter published Monday in the medical journal The Lancet, underlines how severely overwhelmed and understaffed the hospitals in the city continue to be despite the thousands of volunteers the government has deployed.

The government has sought to promote its efforts in the party’s propaganda outlets, hailing the medical workers as patriots while playing down the shortages in hospitals beds, protective gear and medical supplies that have been made worse by a monthlong lockdown.

“We are asking nurses and medical staff from countries around the world to come to China now, to help us in this battle,” read the letter, which was signed by nurses working in isolation units at a Wuhan hospital. “In addition to the physical exhaustion, we are also suffering psychologically. While we are professional nurses, we are also human.”

Severe shortages of protective equipment and health care professionals in Wuhan were exacerbating the tough conditions in isolation wards, the letter said. Wearing thick layers of protective gear for long stretches means having to “speak very loudly” to communicate, while some nurses developed pressure ulcers on their foreheads and ears from masks and goggles, and blisters around their mouths.

Such workers are at particular risk of infection. More than 3,000 medical workers across China have been infected with the virus, according to the Chinese government.

Offers of assistance from doctors and nurses around the world as well from the World Health Organization were ignored in the early weeks of the outbreak.
“Like everyone else, we feel helplessness, anxiety and fear,” the letter said.

Some discharged patients test positive again, Chinese health officials say

Some medical experts point to an alarming finding that calls into question the accuracy of the tests being used to diagnose and release patients: 14 percent of patients discharged from hospitals in China’s populous Guangdong Province have tested positive for the coronavirus during follow-up examinations, according to provincial officials.

It is unclear if these patients are contagious, said Song Tie, a Guangdong health official, during a news conference. But he said that in the city of Guangzhou, for instance, 13 patients had tested positive again after being discharged, but none of their 104 close contacts showed signs of infection.

Officials in several other regions, including Hainan Province in the south and the city of Chengdu in southwestern China, have said they found patients who tested positive after being discharged.

Under China’s latest national treatment plan, patients can be discharged from hospitals only if they have twice tested negative for the virus and have a clear chest scan. Several medical experts have said that patients who were already been infected could not be infected again, because they would have developed immunity.

According to Mr. Song, some experts have speculated that patients’ lungs may still be recovering and undergoing “intermittent detoxification,” releasing the virus even after they are discharged.
But others were skeptical of that explanation, pointing instead to the diagnostic tests, which have already proven unreliable in some cases. Lu Hongzhou, an expert in Shanghai, told the Beijing News that it was more likely that the tests used to discharge patients had failed to detect the virus.

Dr. Jin Dongyan, a virus expert at the University of Hong Kong, was more explicit: He said in an interview that the tests used by many hospitals had likely created false negatives.

Japan insists that Summer Olympics plans are unchanged.

The Japanese government on Wednesday sought to play down concerns that the global spread of the coronavirus would affect the Tokyo Olympics, saying it had no plans to cancel or make other big changes to the Games.

At a regular news briefing, the chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said that preparations for the Games, which are scheduled to open in late July, were proceeding “as planned.”

Mr. Suga offered his assurances a day after The Associated Press published an interview with Dick Pound, a member of the International Olympic Committee, who said the Games might have to be canceled if they could not be held safely.

Mr. Pound said a decision would need to be made no later than May. “In and around that time, I’d say folks are going to have to ask, ‘Is this under sufficient control that we can be confident about going to Tokyo or not?’” he said.
In response to a question about the remarks, Mr. Suga said they were “not the official view of the I.O.C.”

The virus has already affected preparations for the Olympics, particularly in China, where athletes have had to change their training regimens and forgo qualifying events because of restrictions on their travel.

Hoping to curb a gradual increase in reported coronavirus cases in Japan, the authorities on Tuesday called for the cancellation of public gatherings such as sporting events and concerts in the coming weeks.

Japan’s professional soccer and rugby leagues have announced that they will cancel or delay events, while some professional baseball games have been closed to spectato

fac54m,Personal Italy Update: University Programs Suspended,"I joined this subreddit a few days ago and would like to share a few personal notes from my last 48 hours in Italy.

I am one of several hundreds, maybe even thousands, of students who were studying abroad in Italy for the semester. I'm currently writing this post from 35,000 feet over the Atlantic as I, as well as dozens of my friends and peers, abruptly make our way back to the US.

Last week, a meeting was scheduled for my university's program (in Florence) to provide a general discussion and Q&amp;A for the students regarding the virus, precautions, and travel warnings. However, on Tuesday (2/25) afternoon, things rapidly took a sudden turn and we were informed to pack our belongings and leave the Tuscany region no later than Sunday (3/1).

Within a matter of hours, several other universities and programs based in Florence initiated the same evacuation memo. Students were left confused, frightened, and with too many questions to bear.

Nonetheless, the administration attributed the decision due to the government's rapid response to the outbreak and in the fear that the city and region could soon be put into quarantine as others are in Northern Italy.

Obviously I am all for dodging an outbreak of COVID-19 and a lockdown in a foreign city. But now that we are returning to the states, we are not only entering into a potentially similar quarantative situation, but the remainder of our semester, our credits, and coursework is seemingly lost. And administrators are struggling to figure out how we can finish back in the US in order to effectively graduate on time.

The entire vibe amongst students was chaotic, pre-apocalyptic, and ultimately devastating. I packed my bags and left within 36 hours.

Any thoughts on this decision by our school? I'm following carefully to see if other programs across Europe are ended soon as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fac54m/personal_italy_update_university_programs/,2020-02-27 08:33:29,Question,0.0

""I can't believe that the people who survived sanctions, bombings, all kinds of suffering, are getting scared of the most ridiculous virus in the history of mankind, which exists... on Facebook.""

He adds: 

""I was, for example, at this meeting (about the national response) against ordering masks, and against testing. I think that's completely pointless. Look - if we didn't have the test, we wouldn't even know there was an epidemic.
It's already known that the virus is getting less viral. So, the virus is getting weaker and weaker. It's weak anyway. Women...let's say...for woman, yes, estrogen is definitely protecting women. Women have very mild forms of the disease, they're practically not dying from the virus. Right, this new one. 
Therefore, as far as women are concerned, feel free to go shopping...to Italy. I hear there will be great discounts in Italy, because no one will go there now.""

However, only 2\~3 of South Korea's discharged patients are the ones after the spread in the cult and the other 24\~25 were diagnosed before Daegu. Italy and Iran's discharged patients, however, should all be the ones who were infected recently as there were no cases(apart from Chinese tourists in Italy) reported before the major outbreak.

As we know by a Chinese study that 15% of the discharged patients were tested positive again, countries should be more strict in discharging their patients, at least than China. I don't know what are the criteria for this in Italy and Iran, but SK requires patients to test negative around 5 times before they are considered to have recovered and let go. There's no case of a patient tested re-positive in SK at the moment. I'm a bit worried that they are rushing to get the old patients out and hospitalise new patients.

&gt;Last night, the Health Ministry director-general Noor Hisham Abdullah said a 53-year-old Malaysian woman became the 23rd Covid-19 case in Malaysia.  
&gt;  
&gt;Patient 23 had travelled to Japan and developed a fever as soon as she arrived in Malaysia on Feb 23 and was treated at Kuala Lumpur Hospital. She was tested positive for Covid-19 on Feb 27.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then, this afternoon, Noor Hisham announced another two cases - one involving a 41-year-old Japanese citizen (patient 24) working in Malaysia and another is a 54-year-old Italian (patient 25) who is married to a Malaysian.  
&gt;  
&gt; Noor Hisham said the Japanese woman had travelled to Japan last month and Indonesia this month.  
&gt;  
&gt;Covid-19 normally takes up to two weeks to manifest. Indonesia has insisted that it has no Covid-19 cases.  
&gt;  
&gt;Noor Hisham said the Japanese patient came down with fever and had sought treatment on Feb 17. He was warded at a private hospital on Feb 20.  
&gt;  
&gt;""A Covid-19 test was conducted and it was confirmed positive on Feb 27. She is now being treated at the isolation ward in Kuala Lumpur Hospital,"" he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;As for the Italian patient, Noor Hisham said he had travelled to Italy for work from Feb 15 to Feb 21.  
&gt;  
&gt;He began to have symptoms on Feb 22 and sought out-patient treatment for three consecutive days from Feb 23 to Feb 25. His test for Covid-19 came back positive today.  
&gt;  
&gt;""He has been warded at the Sungai Buloh hospital isolation ward for treatment and observation,"" he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Until yesterday, Malaysia has had no new cases of Covid-19 since Feb 15.  
&gt;  
&gt;Both Japan and Italy have been badly hit by the Covid-19 outbreak.  
&gt;  
&gt;To date, Italy has recorded 650 cases while Japan has recorded 186 cases. Indonesia claims it has no cases.  
&gt;  
&gt;Globally, Covid-19 has to date infected 83,272 and claimed 2,858 lives. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fardb3/malaysia_records_three_new_covid19_cases_in_24/,2020-02-28 02:58:54,Local Report,0.04545454545454545

fav5i3,Italy changed the case definition: excluding asymptomatic cases - La Repubblica,"Google Translate:

**In the next few days, data on people affected by coronavirus in Italy will drop or remain stable after days of rapid growth. The change, however, will not be due, probably and unfortunately, to a decrease in the circulation of the virus but to a new system for calculating cases.** From the Ministry of Health they have already informed informally to the Regions what then yesterday morning was partially explained by Giuseppe Ippolito dello Spallanzani during a meeting with the foreign press of the Minister of Health, Roberto Speranza and by that of Foreign Affairs, Luigi Di Maio. ""In Italy - said Ippolito - efforts are being made to communicate only clinically relevant cases of new coronavirus"", that is, those that have important symptoms. In other countries of the world, explained the infectious disease specialist, it does so: ""Those who test positive for swabs made for any other reason, will go to a separate list, but in any case extremely important for the definition of the epidemiological situation"".

**The idea of ​​the ministry is therefore that of not communicating any asymptomatic cases to the international bodies that deal with the epidemic, that is, people who are positive to the swab but do not have any health problems. These infected represent between 40 and 50% of all cases reported at this time.** With rare exceptions they are followed to their home and cannot go out until they have a positive swab because they could still be contagious. Out of 650 cases reported yesterday, 284 are in home isolation because in fact they largely have no symptoms. And even among the 45 recovered there are certainly people who have never had problems.
